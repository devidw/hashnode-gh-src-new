title: Introduction into the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
---

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is how web browser (client side) and web server (server side) communicate with each other.


Communication in terms of HTTP means *requests* and *responses*.


Request
-------


When you enter a URL in the address bar of your browser and hit enter, your browser requests the webpage connected with the entered URL. This is called an HTTP *request*.


That's how such a `GET` request can look like:



```
GET /index.html HTTP/2
Host: david.wolf.gdn

```

After sending such a request, DNS will be used to resolve the domain name `david.wolf.gdn` to its [IP address](https://xn--david-9u04d.to/introduction-and-overview-of-the-internet-protocol-ipv4-and-ipv6).


Once the IP address was found, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) will be used to send the request to the host (`david.wolf.gdn`).


Response
--------


Once the initial requests find its way to the targeted host, HTTP is used to identify the requested file.


### 200


When the file was found on the host and everything is okay, an HTTP *response* is sent back to the client.



```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:39:15 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.54
Last-Modified: Son, 21 Nov 2021 19:13:03 GMT
Content-Length: 512
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content: <html>…</html>

```

The HTTP status code `200` in the first line of the HTTP response tells us that the requested file was found and everything is `OK`.


At the bottom of the response, we are receiving the actual `Content`, `<html>…</html>`, of the file send by the web server. 


In this case, it's HTML code, as defined in the MIME-type `text/html` in `Content-Type`.


### 404


When the file is not found on the host, there is nothing that could be send back.


That's when we receive an HTTP error `404`:



```
HTTP/2 400 Not Found

```

And that's it for a short introduction into HTTP.


If I got you interested, there is plenty more to explore for you:


* There are bunch more request methods, in this article you have seen a `GET` request. There are other methods like `POST` to submit data using HTTP. And that's not the end of the story, there are even more.
* Same goes for HTTP response status codes, there are many more.


Have fun checking out the technology!
