title: Introduction into primary keys in relational databases
---

You just learned about the core concept of relational databases and how they are built up in databases, tables, rows, and columns? And now you want to take it further â€” good decision. In this article, we will speak about an important concept in the design of relational databases: keys.


Introduction
------------


So let's keep on that track of gaining new knowledge and directly dive into the important role of keys in databases.


Fundamentally, there are a bunch of different keys available for usage in databases. For the scope of this article, we will mainly focus on the most significant key database design: the *primary key*.


Imagine you are working on a web application, and it's your job to create the database tables for this application. Let's say you have created the following table to store the users' data, including their `name` and their `password`.





| name | password |
| Alisa | 3z]Eu&n\_ |
| John | n+xL6h<f |
| Jane | 37?,wW;u |
| John | @'bYVP5" |


Beside the fact that passwords should **never ever** be stored in plain text, rather they have to be stored as hashes, there is another problem in that table.


Imagine some registered users wants to delete his/her account in your application.


To perform a delete operation, we have to tell the database server which record we want to delete.


So let's say `Alisa` wants to delete her account. Here is what happens:


1. She passes her name to the application,
2. the application turns that into a format our database server understands and sends it to the server,
3. the server executes the incoming query and the user with the `name` of `Alisa` gets removed from the system.


After the deletion, our database table will look like the following:





| name | password |
| John | n+xL6h<f |
| Jane | 37?,wW;u |
| John | @'bYVP5" |


Now let's say `John` wants to delete his account, too. 


Beside the fact that we are building a bad web application, when 2 of 4 of our users are deleting their accounts ðŸ˜„, here is when the previously mentioned problems comes into game.


There are two records and both of them have a `name` of `John`, but we only have the `name` of `John`, nothing more to identify him.


So, what would happen here, when `John` triggers that delete button, is that his account can not be deleted in a way it should.


That's so because there is no way for the system to know which of those users accounts wants to have his account deleted: is it `John` or is it`John`?


In the worst-case scenario, both `John`s would get deleted.


You get the problem.


So, now, what to do?


### Primary keys


The solution for that problem is to give the database table a column with a unique key, which will automatically be generated and also incremented each time we store a new record in our table. This type of key is a called a *primary key*.


In other words: keys are a way to store each row in a table as a unique row.





| id | name | password |
| 1 | Alisa | 3z]Eu&n\_ |
| 2 | John | n+xL6h<f |
| 3 | Jane | 37?,wW;u |
| 4 | John | @'bYVP5" |


Looking back at our `John`s, when we have a column with a key, an identification column, commonly named as `id`. We can now easily make sure we get the right record by using its unique identification stored in the `id`-column to perform any type of operation on that user.


Conclusion
----------


Problem solved. Knowledge gained!


Congratulations, you have just earned the *primary key* to your magic keychain of database development. Use it wisely.
